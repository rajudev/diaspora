Type: string
Default: http://localhost:3000/
Description: Set hostname for your diaspora pod
 Set the hostname of the machine you're running Diaspora on, as seen
 from the internet. This should be the domain name you want to use to
 access the pod. So if you plan to use a reverse proxy, it should be
 the hostname the proxy listens on. DO NOT CHANGE THIS AFTER INITIAL SETUP!
 If you do change the hostname, you will have to start again as the hostname
 will be hardcoded into the database.

 Examples: example.com, pod.example.com etc
