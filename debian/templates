Template: diaspora/url
Type: string
Default: http://localhost:3000/
Description: Set hostname for your diaspora pod
 Set the hostname of the machine you're running Diaspora on, as seen
 from the internet. This should be the URL you want to use to
 access the pod. So if you plan to use a reverse proxy, it should be
 the URL the proxy listens on. DO NOT CHANGE THIS AFTER INITIAL SETUP!
 However changing http to https is okay and has no consequences.
 If you do change the URL, you will have to start again as the URL
 will be hardcoded into the database.
